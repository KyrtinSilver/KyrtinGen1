        "\n",
        "Last week, the team at Stability AI open-sourced [SDXL](https://replicate.com/blog/run-sdxl-with-an-api), the newest and most powerful version of Stable Diffusion yet. Replicate was ready from day one with a hosted version of SDXL that you can [run from the web](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/sdxl) or using our [cloud API](https://replicate.com/blog/run-sdxl-with-an-api).\n",
        "\n",
        "Today, we're following up to announce fine-tuning support for SDXL 1.0. In this blog post, we'll show you how to train SDXL on your own images with one line of code and publish the fine-tuned result as your own hosted public or private model."
